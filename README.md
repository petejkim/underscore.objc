# Underscore.cocoa

Underscore.cocoa is a utility-belt library for Objective-C & Cocoa that provides a lot of the functional programming support that you would expect in languages like Ruby, but without extending any of the built-in Foundation classes. It is heavily inspired by [Underscore.js](http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore).
